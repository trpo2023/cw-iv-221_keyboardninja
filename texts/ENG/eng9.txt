Britain is one of the most highly industrialised countries in the world: for every person employed in agriculture 12 are employed in industry. The original base of British industry was coal-mining, iron and steel and textiles. Today the most productive sectors include high-tech industries, chemicals, finance and the service sectors, especially banking, insurance and tourism.

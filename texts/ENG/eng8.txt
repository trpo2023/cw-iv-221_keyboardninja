Consumers learn to generalize from what they have learned. So advertisers sometimes copy a highly successful idea that has been well learned by consumers. For example, the highly successful 'Weston Tea Country' advertising for different tea has led to 'DAEWOO Country' for automobile dealers and 'Cadbury Country' for chocolate bars.
